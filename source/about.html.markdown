## About me


My name is Joost Calis. I'm 31 years old, living in Bussum with my wife and 4 year old son. Before starting this coding adventure I was a baseball coach at HCAW in Bussum.


Growing up my life was mainly focused around baseball. I started playing when I was 3 years old, and never looked back. I played in most of the dutch junior national teams and baseball was part of the schedule for 6 days a week. A shoulder injury and 2 unsuccessful surgeries brought a pretty abrupt end to that when i was around 18.


After this I've had a wide variety of jobs that got the bills payed but didn't necessarily give me much fulfillment. Looking back I think I've had a hard time finding the same passion I had for baseball in another area of my life. Until I signed up for this developers bootcamp!

 It's funny how in two such different fields you can end up feeling that same passion and drive to perform and keep learning and getting better.


Some of my qualities are:


* Hard worker
* Fast learner
* Strong team player
* Logical thinker
* Always excited about new information and learning opportunities
