In December 2015 I got an email from a friend of mine about this developers bootcamp starting in January 2016. The first thing that came to mind were all the usual excuses of why not to do something. I had kind of gotten a pro at finding these excuses.. But as cliche as it may sound, for some reason this time it was different.

Right after those initial thoughts, I started thinking it would be really cool to actually learn how to build things. The thought that soon I might actually be able to make sense of all those weird programming names and use them, seemed both completely unrealistic and incredibly tempting at the same time. So I actually ignored all those excuses in my head and went ahead and wrote an application letter. And man am I glad I did!

I am typing this after just having finished the 5 week bootcamp. And what a crazy, amazing,
intense but mostly fun 5 weeks they have been. I got introduced to a world that got my juices flowing, that challenged my brain in a way it hadn't been challenged in a long time, but above all, that introduced me to some pretty amazing people. So yeah to me this does feel like the start of a great adventure, I hope that while writing this blog i can translate some of that world into words. If I don't.. well sorry, I'm learning how to code, not to write blogs :)
